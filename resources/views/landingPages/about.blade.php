                    <p>Austin Area Urban League Young Professionals [AAULYP's or YP's] are committed to helping make
                        Austin a better city through diversity and urban culture. The purpose and mission of the Urban
                        League and the Young Professionals in particular is to provide young people with resources that
                        encourage networking and interaction with social, cultural, educational and political
                        institutions and to help cultivate innovative ideas and dynamic dialogue in Austin amongst
                        “Young Professionals”.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, significant steps have been made in removing the early prejudices and barriers,
                        thus allowing many of our constituents to learn to grow, and to thrive in the Austin community.
                        As we move forward with our programs, we have been able to adapt to the ever-changing Austin
                        environment - one that has grown from being merely the state capital to that of a thriving
                        technological hub that incorporates the community, government, and the business sectors.</p>
